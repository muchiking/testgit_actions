#     steps:
#       # The shell and env declaration needs to be associated with a step
#       # It's better to define environment variables directly within a 'step' or 'job' block.
#       # If you want it for a specific step, put it under that step.
#       # If you want it for all steps in a job, put it under the 'job' level, like this:
#       # env:
#       #   SEC: ${{ secrets.SEC }}
#       # For demonstration, I'll place it directly where you tried to use it.
